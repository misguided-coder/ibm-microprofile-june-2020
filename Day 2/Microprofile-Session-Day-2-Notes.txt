Recap for DAY 1

JEE 8 
   - future development was stopped by Oracle and JEE 8 was donated to Eclipse under project name 
     called "Jakarta" 
         - JAX-RS, JSONP,JSONB,CDI - MicroProfile

Q) What is the need for Eclipse MicroProfile, when we have other tools in Java for building MS?

Q) Tell me the name of 3 implementations where I can deploy MS built using MP?

Q) Why JAX-RS is chosen as a primary standard for building MS by MP team?

Q) How MP REST Client differs from JAX-RS based client?
